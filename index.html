        <p>I am a 25 year old Individual. <br/>
            I like to play sports, learn new skills, and spend ample time in leisure.<br/>
             I am presently at this point of life where I have started to take life seriously and build myself block by block, in all the areas that I am lacking.<br/>
            Learning web development is one of the steps in my career field where I am planting the seeds to see the future tree, full of leaves and flowers. </p>
